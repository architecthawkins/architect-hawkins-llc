                                    I founded Architect Hawkins LLC with the mission of creating a design firm that provides quality design services in the commercial and residential sectors.

                                    Design is about making decisions - lots of them, and at many different stages.
                                    Some decisions come easy, others require research and input.
                                    Such as in life, some decisions are small and can wait, and there are those that can not.

                                    I help you navigate the process of conceptualizing a design idea and
                                    create sizable and measurable steps to move forward to realization.

                                    I find that there are 3 interdependent factors to any project that will determine
                                    overall success.  While the basis of a project may vary in scope, schedule and cost â€“
                                    it is the balance  and interplay of these that will result in a successful project for all involved.
