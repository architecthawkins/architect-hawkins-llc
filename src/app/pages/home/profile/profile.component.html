                                <p>
                                    I founded Architect Hawkins LLC with the mission of creating a design firm
                                    that provides quality design services in the commercial and residential sectors.
                                </p>

                                    Design is about making decisions - lots of them, and at many different stages.
                                    Some decisions come easy, others require research and input. Such as in life,
                                    some decisions are small and can wait, and there are those that can not.

                                    I help you navigate the process of conceptualizing a design idea and create
                                    sizable and measurable steps to move forward to realization.
